          This is a courtesy translation. The French version of this document is the legally binding
          one; in the event of any discrepancy in interpretation, the French version prevails.
        </P>
        <H2>1. Purpose</H2>
        <P>
          These terms of use govern the use of the Konforme platform, a web accessibility audit
          service published by KAYZEN SASU. By creating an account, you accept them without
          reservation.
        </P>
        <H2>2. Account and access</H2>
        <P>
          Access to the dashboard requires an account (Google authentication). You are responsible
          for keeping your credentials confidential and for any action carried out from your
          account.
        </P>
        <H2>3. Use of the audit service</H2>

            'You may only audit websites that you own or for which you have obtained authorisation.',
            'The audit robot (KonformeBot) performs standard HTTP requests, limited to a few pages per audit.',
            'Using the service to overload, probe or attack third-party websites is prohibited.',
          ]}
        />
        <H2>4. Limits of the service</H2>
        <P>
          The automated audit covers the accessibility criteria that can be verified by machine. On
          its own, it does not constitute a guarantee of full legal compliance: some RGAA/WCAG
          criteria require human verification. Results are provided for information purposes only,
          with no guarantee of completeness.
        </P>
        <H2>5. Liability</H2>
        <P>
          KAYZEN SASU implements reasonable means to ensure the availability of the service, without
          any obligation to achieve a specific result. KAYZEN SASU may not be held liable for
          indirect damages resulting from the use or unavailability of the service.
        </P>
        <H2>6. Governing law</H2>
        <P>
          These terms of use are governed by French law. Courts having jurisdiction: Lyon, France.

        <H2>1. Offers</H2>
        <P>
          Konforme offers a free plan (automated audit) and paid services (assisted audits,
          remediation work, monitoring subscriptions). Paid services are subject to a quotation or
          an online subscription setting out the price, the duration and the scope.
        </P>
        <H2>2. Prices and payment</H2>
        <P>
          Prices are expressed in euros excluding taxes. Payment is made upon subscription or
          according to the payment schedule set out in the quotation. Any late payment gives rise to
          penalties at the statutory rate.
        </P>
        <H2>3. Withdrawal</H2>
        <P>
          In accordance with article L221-3 of the French Consumer Code, the 14-day right of
          withdrawal applies to consumer customers and, subject to conditions, to professionals with
          fewer than 6 employees acting outside their main field of activity.
        </P>
        <H2>4. Termination</H2>
        <P>
          Subscriptions may be cancelled at any time from the dashboard or by email; termination
          takes effect at the end of the current period.
